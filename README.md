# Project Description
The focus of this project involves analyzing Adventure_Works datasets to monitor their essential metrics. This was done by utilizing SQL to extract the relevant information and using Power BI to create a dashboard to track the metrics.

NOTE: Due to the large size of the database (>50MB): I used Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage the files by storing them outside the Git repository.
This was the command I used in doing that:

#### Tracked the large files using Git LFS
- git lfs install
- git lfs track "Database path"
- git lfs track "Database path"

#### Commit and push the changes
- git add .gitattributes folder path
- git commit -m "Use Git LFS for large files"
- git push origin main
